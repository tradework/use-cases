Use-case #1: I want to sell these items.

  Sub-case #1: I want to sell these physical items to buyers who are local to me.
  I have a list of items that I have in my possession (or reasonably quick access to) that I want to sell to people who are willing to come to my location to pick the items up or who are willing to meet me at a location near wherever I am (e.g. so as not to reveal a personal address).

    Minimal Feature Dependencies:
      * Inventory editor
      * Signal for being open or closed for trading
      * Location marker
      * Trader search/list

    Future Expectations:
      * Transaction handling
      * Multiple inventories
      * Promotions


  Sub-case #2: I want to sell these virtual items.

  This is just a simpler version of #1.
